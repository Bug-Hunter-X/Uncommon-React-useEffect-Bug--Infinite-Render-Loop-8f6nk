This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React's `useEffect` hook.  The example shows how omitting the dependency array can lead to an infinite render loop, impacting performance.  The solution illustrates the correct usage of the dependency array to resolve the issue. This is especially crucial for beginners learning about useEffect or for developers working on more complex projects where performance is critical.
